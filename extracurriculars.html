	<p>I grew up skiing in Tahoe and have been skiing for as long as I can remember. I ski on the freeride team at Sugarbowl Mountain. My two main coaches(Ethan and Seamus) have shaped my ski style to be a blend of agressive skiing(Seamus) with a flowly smoothness and rythem(Ethan). This 2022-23 season has been a historic year for powder days and good snow. Accodring to my personal numbers, I skied more storms this year than blue bird days which is very rare for the mid sierras.</p>

           <p>A second hobby I have is camping/exploring. From backpaacking to car camping being out in nature is a great experience. From standing around a fire at night, night hiking under the stars, and dehydrated MREs for breakfast, lunch and dinner, theres nothing like some solid time away from the city.</p>
