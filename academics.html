	<p>The 2022-2023 school year was my first highschool year at Piedmont High. I transferred back to piedmont this year for my sophmore year. I took two advanced classes this year which were AP csp and Honors Chemistry. My favorite class this year was probaly english because of the teacher who also plays guitar. Chemistry has been my hardest class this year. I am ready for summer.</p>
